What Is Microservices Architecture?
Microservices architecture is a service-oriented architecture (SOA) variant in which an application comprises a collection of lightweight, loosely coupled, modular services. These services can be built to execute on various platforms and independently developed, tested, deployed, and managed.

Microservices architecture can replace long-running, complicated monolithic systems requiring considerable resource and management overhead. Microservice is a word that refers to a service having a limited set of functionalities rather than referring to the length of the code used to create it.
